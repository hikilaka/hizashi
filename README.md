# Hizashi

Hizashi is an IRC bot that is able to reload services on-the-fly without sacrificing down time. Development is still underway, therefore this repository is unoperational. See [hizashi v2](https://github.com/hikilaka/hizashi_irc_bot/) for a version of this bot that is operational. This project is a cleaner rewrite of the aforementioned repository.

### Installation

Install the dependencies and start Hizashi.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/hikilaka/hizashi
$ cd hizashi
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Don't forget to configure your irc server settings `config.json`!

### Services

No services are included at this time as the bot is still under development.
